# Diagnostic Reports Index

**Purpose:** Storage for timestamped diagnostic reports from setup verification runs

---

## Directory Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive diagnostic reports generated by the VHDL-FORGE diagnostic system prompt. Each report captures:
- Complete environment state
- Package structure verification
- Import tests
- Test runner validation
- Issues found and remediation steps

## Report Naming Convention

Reports use timestamp-based naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`

**Example:** `2025-11-08-18-30-45.md`

## How to Generate a Report

**Two versions available:**

### Version 2.0 (RECOMMENDED - Automated Script Support)
1. **Copy the diagnostic system prompt** from `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2.md`
2. **Paste into Claude Code** (web or desktop)
3. **Claude will automatically:**
   - Check for automated scripts (`scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/validate_setup.sh`)
   - Run automated validation if scripts available
   - Fall back to manual diagnostics if needed
   - Generate report in this directory
   - Provide actionable recommendations (prioritizing automated fixes)

**Use v2.0 when:**
- Repository has automated setup scripts (commits after bbf3337)
- Want fastest diagnostic with automated fixes
- Need comprehensive validation

### Version 1.0 (Manual Workflow)
1. **Copy the diagnostic system prompt** from `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
2. **Paste into Claude Code** (web or desktop)
3. **Claude will manually:**
   - Run all diagnostic phases
   - Capture output
   - Analyze results
   - Generate report in this directory
   - Provide actionable recommendations

**Use v1.0 when:**
- Repository does not have automated scripts
- Need detailed manual diagnostics
- Debugging script issues

## Report Structure

Each report contains:
- **Executive Summary** - Overall status and issue count
- **Phase 1-6 Results** - Detailed diagnostic output
- **Issue Analysis** - Categorized problems
- **Recommended Actions** - Step-by-step fixes
- **Environment Snapshot** - For reproduction

## Latest Reports

- **2025-11-09-00:58:41** - Initial diagnostic run (⚠️ WARNINGS) [v1.0 format]
  - Status: Package structure ✅, imports ✅, test runner ✅, GHDL ❌
  - Blocking: GHDL not installed
  - Resolution: Install GHDL via package manager
  - Notes: Verified package structure fix from commit 6069c49
  - Format: v1.0 (manual workflow - predates automated scripts)

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Initial Setup Verification
- Clone repository
- Run diagnostic prompt
- Verify environment is correct
- Fix any issues found
- Re-run to confirm fixes

### Pattern 2: Issue Investigation
- Error occurs during development
- Run diagnostic prompt to capture state
- Review report for patterns
- Apply fixes
- Generate new report to verify

### Pattern 3: CI/CD Integration
- Automated diagnostics on push
- Reports stored as artifacts
- Compare reports across commits
- Track environment stability

## Report Versions

### Version 2.0 (Current - 2025-11-09+)
- **New in v2.0:** Automated script integration
- **Features:**
  - Checks for `scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/validate_setup.sh`
  - Runs automated validation when available
  - Falls back to manual workflow if scripts missing
  - Prioritizes automated fixes in recommendations
- **When:** Use for repositories with automated setup scripts (commits after bbf3337)
- **Prompt:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2.md`

### Version 1.0 (Original - 2025-11-08)
- **Features:**
  - Manual diagnostic workflow (Phases 1-6)
  - Comprehensive manual checks
  - Detailed troubleshooting
- **When:** Use for repositories without automated scripts, or debugging script issues
- **Prompt:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

**Backward Compatibility:** Both versions generate compatible reports. v2.0 adds automation metadata.

## Integration with Documentation

Diagnostic reports reference:
- `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2.md` - v2.0 diagnostic prompt (RECOMMENDED)
- `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` - v1.0 diagnostic prompt (fallback)
- `docs/SETUP_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Known issues and fixes
- `scripts/setup.sh` - Automated setup script
- `scripts/validate_setup.sh` - Automated validation script
- `SPEC.md` - System requirements
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development environment setup

## Cleanup Policy

**Retention:** Keep last 30 reports (or 90 days, whichever is fewer)

**Archival:** Critical reports (major issues, fixes) should be preserved

**Privacy:** Diagnostic reports may contain:
- File paths (usually safe)
- Environment variables (review before sharing)
- No credentials or secrets (verified in diagnostic prompt design)
