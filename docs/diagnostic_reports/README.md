# Diagnostic Reports Index

**Purpose:** Storage for timestamped diagnostic reports from setup verification runs

---

## Directory Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive diagnostic reports generated by the VHDL-FORGE diagnostic system prompt. Each report captures:
- Complete environment state
- Package structure verification
- Import tests
- Test runner validation
- Issues found and remediation steps

## Report Naming Convention

Reports use timestamp-based naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`

**Example:** `2025-11-08-18-30-45.md`

## How to Generate a Report

1. **Copy the diagnostic system prompt** from `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
2. **Paste into Claude Code** (web or desktop)
3. **Claude will automatically:**
   - Run all diagnostic phases
   - Capture output
   - Analyze results
   - Generate report in this directory
   - Provide actionable recommendations

## Report Structure

Each report contains:
- **Executive Summary** - Overall status and issue count
- **Phase 1-6 Results** - Detailed diagnostic output
- **Issue Analysis** - Categorized problems
- **Recommended Actions** - Step-by-step fixes
- **Environment Snapshot** - For reproduction

## Latest Reports

- **2025-11-09-00:58:41** - Initial diagnostic run (⚠️ WARNINGS)
  - Status: Package structure ✅, imports ✅, test runner ✅, GHDL ❌
  - Blocking: GHDL not installed
  - Resolution: Install GHDL via package manager
  - Notes: Verified package structure fix from commit 6069c49

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Initial Setup Verification
- Clone repository
- Run diagnostic prompt
- Verify environment is correct
- Fix any issues found
- Re-run to confirm fixes

### Pattern 2: Issue Investigation
- Error occurs during development
- Run diagnostic prompt to capture state
- Review report for patterns
- Apply fixes
- Generate new report to verify

### Pattern 3: CI/CD Integration
- Automated diagnostics on push
- Reports stored as artifacts
- Compare reports across commits
- Track environment stability

## Integration with Documentation

Diagnostic reports reference:
- `docs/SETUP_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Known issues and fixes
- `SPEC.md` - System requirements
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development environment setup

## Cleanup Policy

**Retention:** Keep last 30 reports (or 90 days, whichever is fewer)

**Archival:** Critical reports (major issues, fixes) should be preserved

**Privacy:** Diagnostic reports may contain:
- File paths (usually safe)
- Environment variables (review before sharing)
- No credentials or secrets (verified in diagnostic prompt design)
